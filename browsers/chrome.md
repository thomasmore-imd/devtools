## 1.1. Developer Tools

### 1.1.1. Preferences

The developer tools come with their own set of advanced settings. To open these settings you can either use the menu button next to the close button, or use the hotkey `F1` while your devtools are open.

* Appearance
  * It is possible to change the color scheme of your developer tools.
    * Light \(default\)
    * Dark 
* Network
  * Disable cache \(while DevTools is open\)
    * While developing you often need to refresh your cache to see your changes.
    * This setting auto disables the cache with the devtools open.
  * Preserve log
    * Allows you to save your logs between navigation.
    * Especially useful with auto redirecting javascript pages showing errors!
* Debugger
  * Disable JavaScript
    * With this toggle you can test how your site works without Javascript enabled.
    * This can highlight issues with not being able to visit poor programmed preloaders for example, as without Javascript the overlay will never vanish.

#### 1.1.1.1. Device Toolbar

In the top left of the developer tools you can find a toggle to activate the device toolbar. This interface lets you simulate any website as how it would look on a mobile device. By using this system you won't need to manually rescale your browser screen anymore while working mobile first! In many cases this simulation can also represent the looks of your websites more accurately than manually changing the browser size.

This tool comes with a up-to-date selection of devices to choose from, but it's also possible to enter your custom dimensions.

While testing the load performance of your app, this tool can be extra useful as you can use presets based on different mobile network setups to simulate your website its performance.
